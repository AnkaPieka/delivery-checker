# LLM Usage

This project was created with limited assistance from an LLM (ChatGPT 4.0 and Claude Sonnet 4). The tool was used as a support resource, but the implementation and logic are entirely mine.

## What I used the LLM for:

- Clarifying the algorithmic problem (input/output expectations)
- Helping define the project architecture
- Debugging TypeScript module resolution (Node + ts-node + ESM issues)
- Structuring the UI timeline visualization with Tailwind and Material UI
- Review and optimize the final code for better performance and readability
- Writing a clear and concise README

## What I did manually:

- Designed and implemented the `checkDelivery` algorithm from scratch
- Structured and coded the React UI
- Handled all TypeScript types and project structure
- Wrote and refactored all logic without code generation

## Why I used an LLM:

Mainly to speed up troubleshooting and validate my architectural decisions. The code logic was reasoned and tested manually.
